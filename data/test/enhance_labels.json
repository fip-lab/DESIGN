Some reviewers find them to be overpriced, while others find them to be affordable and within their budget. However, one reviewer believes that the low prices may be due to a mediocre overall experience.\n\nLan Hong House is known for offering authentic and well-prepared food at an affordable price. Some drinks may be slightly overpriced, but the overall menu is reasonably priced. The atmosphere is described as lively yet welcoming, making it suitable for intimate conversations.\n\nBased on these reviews, Shanghai Family Restaurant and Lan Hong House seem to offer good value for the money, while Jinling Noodle Bar's value may vary depending on the individual's experience."

The Gandhi is praised for its tasty and authentic Indian dishes, particularly the chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, and korma. Kohinoor is highly recommended for its delicious tandoori chicken, korma, and samosas. Mahal of Cambridge is known for its exceptional food, especially the vegetarian options, and the fact that it is gluten-free. However, some reviewers found the food at Mahal of Cambridge to be lacking in spices. Overall, all three restaurants offer high-quality food, but it ultimately depends on your personal preferences."

While they were initially described as spotless and modern, there was a need to request a second cleaning, suggesting that the cleanliness may not have been consistently maintained. \n\nAs for Lovell Lodge, the cleanliness of the bathrooms also varied. In some instances, they were described as exceptionally clean, while in others, they were not recently cleaned and appeared to have been used by someone else. However, there were also descriptions of the bathrooms and other restroom facilities being pristine and clean. \n\nRegarding Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge, the available knowledge suggests that the bathroom was initially perceived as clean, with no imperfections found. However, upon closer inspection, there was an issue with the water when trying to take a shower. \n\nBased on this information, it is difficult to determine which hotel has the cleanest bathrooms."
